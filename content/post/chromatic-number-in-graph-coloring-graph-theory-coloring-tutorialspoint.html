We can color one side of the graph with one color and the other side with a second color. Loop at node &#039; + node.label) The solutions guide to this problem says the chromatic number is 2, but i keep getting 3. A graph whose maximum clique is equal to its chromatic number is called perfect. it was a famous open problem to classify all perfect graphs which was recently as for your second question, beyond the trivial clique number is less than or equal to the chromatic number, there is no strong connection.</p>

In its simplest form , it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Clearly, this cannot happen for any of the {c1. • the number of colors c(g) needed to color graph g properly is called the chromatic number of g. Chromatic number (plural chromatic numbers). Loop at node &#039; + node.label) This will produce a valid coloring. Chromatic number is the minimum number of colors required to properly color any graph. If you look at a tree, for instance, you can obviously color it in two colors, but the chromatic polynomial p(k), is the number of ways to color a graph within k colors.</p>
