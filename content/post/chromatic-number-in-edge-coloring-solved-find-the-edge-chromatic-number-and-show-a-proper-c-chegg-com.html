An injective vertex coloring of g is a coloring of the vertices of g so that any two vertices with a common neighbor. The other graph coloring problems like edge coloring (no vertex is incident to two edges of same color) and face coloring (geographical map coloring) can be transformed into vertex coloring.

While graph coloring, the constraints that are set on the graph are colors, order of coloring, the way of assigning simply put, no two vertices of an edge should be of the same color. Just like with vertex coloring, we might insist that edges that are adjacent must be colored differently.
